# 객체지향 프로그래밍 Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

[JAVA 09](https://detegice.github.io/chapter4-01-object-oriented-programming/)

> Object-oriented programming (OOP) involves programming using objects.

# 클래스와 객체 Class and Object

[JAVA 10](https://detegice.github.io/chapter4-02-class-and-object/#%ED%81%B4%EB%9E%98%EC%8A%A4%EC%99%80-%EA%B0%9D%EC%B2%B4)

> A class defines the properties and behaviors for objects.

> An object represents an entity in the real world that can be distinctly identified.
>
> For example, a student, a desk, a circle, a button, and even a loan can all be viewed as objects. 
>
> An object has a unique identity, state, and behavior.

# 생성자 Constructor

[JAVA 10](https://detegice.github.io/chapter4-02-class-and-object/#%EC%83%9D%EC%84%B1%EC%9E%90-constructor)

> A constructor is invoked to create an object using the ``new`` operator.

> A constructor must have the same name as the class itself.
>
> Constructors do not have a return type—not even void.
>
> Constructors are invoked using the new operator when an object is created. Constructors play the role of initializing objects.
