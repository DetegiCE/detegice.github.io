# DESCRIPTION
m이 주어졌을때 m * n를 정수의 제곱수로 만드는 최소의 n을 찾아라.

Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer m and find the smallest integer n such that m * n is a perfect square. (Hint: Store all smallest factors of m into an array list. n is the product of the factors that appear an odd number of times in the array list. For example, consider m = 90, store the factors 2, 3, 3, 5 in an array list. 2 and 5 appear an odd number of times in the array list. So, n is 10.) Here are sample runs:

# INPUT
* Line 1 : 테스트케이스 T (1~1,000)

* Line 2 ~ T+1 : m (1~10,000 범위의 정수)

# OUTPUT
* Line 1 ~ T : m * n 을 Sample Output 형식으로 출력

 

# SAMPLE INPUT
```
3
90
1500
63
```

# SAMPLE OUTPUT
```
900 = 90 x 10
22500 = 1500 x 15
441 = 63 x 7
```
